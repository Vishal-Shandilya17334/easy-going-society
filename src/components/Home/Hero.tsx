              One of my former colleagues once told me that I am a person of many parts. Today when I think over it, a little
              more deeply, I tend to see myself as â€” a learner by nature, a teacher by profession, a student by attitude, a poet by
              heart, a philosopher by temperament, and a wanderer by hobby. These parts are manifested through my
              experience in Teaching, Research, Extension, and Administration.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              The teaching career of 20 years enriched me by providing opportunity to work in different types of educational
              institutions situated in different geographies; to meet some of the most wonderful people on earth and to make
              me learn those nuances of life that would not have been otherwise possible.
